              Why wouldn't I hire a full-time developer?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              To start with, the average yearly cost of a full-time senior
              full-stack developer now exceeds â‚¬140,000 plus benefits (and good
              luck finding one available). Aside from that, you may not always
              have enough work to keep them busy at all times, so you're stuck
              paying for time you aren't able to utilize. With the monthly plan,
              you can pause and resume your subscription as often as you need to
              ensure you're only paying your developer when you have work
              available for them.

            <AccordionTrigger>Can I cancel or get a refund?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Yes. You will never pay for something you are not happy with. Once
              enrolled you can cancel or pause anytime. According to your needs.

            <AccordionContent>
              MakerMode is an agency of one. This means you work directly with
              me. This might mean that I will have a lot to do from time to time
              leading to longer response times. But no requests will take more
              than 48 hours to get feedback on. But it also mean no long email
              threads with consultant brokers, no boring meetings with
              procurement departments or long administrative processes and
              manager meetings. Just direct dialogue with me, Jonas.

              What tools and stacks do you use?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              I use Replit for building and deploying apps. But in general I use
              a lot of tools depending on the complexity. I try to keep it
              simple. I have a go-to stack for most projects, but I am also
              happy to use whatever tools and frameworks needed for each
              project. Most web apps are built using React.

              Is there any projects you don't do?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              I don't do AI apps, 3D modelling, game- or animation projects for
              example. Also, I claim the right to say no to any requests that
              may violate my foundational values.

            <AccordionTrigger>
              What if I only have a single request?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              No problem. You can pause your subscription when finished and
              return when you have additional requests and needs. There's no
              need to let the remainder of your subscription go to waste.
